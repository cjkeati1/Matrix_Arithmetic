# Matrix Arithmetic
Performs various matrix operations and clearly displays each calculation made allowing for easy understanding.

###### Matrix Addition
- Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added.
- The sum of two matrices **A** and **B** will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as **A** and **B**.
- The sum of **A** and **B**, denoted **A + B**, is computed by adding corresponding elements of **A** and **B**.

###### Matrix Subtraction
- Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be subtracted.
- The difference of two matrices **A** and **B** will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as **A** and **B**.
- The difference of **A** and **B**, denoted **A - B**, is computed by subtracted corresponding elements of **A** and **B**.

###### Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix **A** must have the same number of columns as **B** does rows in order to be multiplied with eachother.
- If **A** is an *n × m* matrix and **B** is an *m × p* matrix, their matrix product **A × B** is an *n × p* matrix.
- The *m* entries across a row of **B** are multiplied with the *m* entries down a column of **B** and summed to produce an entry of **A × B**.

###### Scalar Multiplication
 - Denoted *λ***A**, where *λ* is some scalar and **A** is a matrix, scalar multiplication multiplies every element in matrix **A** by the scalar *λ*.
